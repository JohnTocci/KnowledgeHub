# Contributing to KnowledgeHub

We love your input! We want to make contributing to KnowledgeHub as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnTocci/KnowledgeHub.git
   cd KnowledgeHub
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # If available
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Code Style
